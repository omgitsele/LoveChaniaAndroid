Tucked away in a narrow side street in the old quarter of Chania, Casa Veneta has plenty of olde worlde charm.

It is a new, four storey building which we have sympathetically reconstructed from an old Venetian facade. For your convenience we have a television lounge on the ground floor. We have kept the atmosphere of the Grand Venetian period by using stripped polished wood for our interiors, and giving some studios a gallery bedroom.

A friendly, most charming base in an excellent location from which to explore this historic and atmospheric town.
