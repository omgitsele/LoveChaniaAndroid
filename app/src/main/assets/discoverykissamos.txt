Kissamos might be the centre of the municipality, very close by there might be 3 destinations famous the world over (Elafonisos, the Balos Lagoon and Falassarna), yet it remains completely untouched and authentic. The mass tourism that floods Crete every summer is yet to conquer the town of Kissamos which though it has everything (Health Centre, banks, shops, hotels, offices etc), it still keeps the principals of family and Cretan hospitality intact. In the town and villages of Kissamos you will not find touristy meals or inhospitable people. You will find family businesses, people who respect and love the visitor, the newcomer, just a little bit more.
