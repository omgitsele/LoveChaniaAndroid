4 km west of Chora Sfakia is Glyka Nera, one of the most beautiful beaches of southern Crete. Isolated, made of pebble and emerald green waters, its most important feature is the water flows directly into the sea and can also be found by digging through the pebbles. Accessible on foot or by boat from Loutro and Chora Sfakia Glyka Nera (Freshwater) is equipped for tourists and has toilets, bar, tavern, sun loungers and parasols. The beach is also frequented by nudists.
