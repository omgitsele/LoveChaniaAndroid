Once upon a time, there was a rich and prosperous city of Crete. Established in the minoenne period, it was inhabited during the Hellenistic and Roman time, to be abandoned further because of the uprising of the west coast of the island. Therefore, the ruins of the ancient port, located today in Cape Koutr? rises to nearly 6 m above the sea... You can admire there the ruins of a throne, an Acropolis and the antique city.
