This monastery built in the seventeenth century, was dedicated to Panagia Hodigitria, the virgin who shows the way. Inside lies a small museum that contains a collection of important post-Byzantine icons and other objects of great value. Moni Gonias is surrounded by the lush vegetation of the peninsula Rodopou, a wonderful place, virtually uninhabited and ideal for hiking. Here are also the ruins of the sanctuary of the goddess Diktynna, located above the bay Meneies.
