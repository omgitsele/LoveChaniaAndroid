The archaeological Museum of Kissamos was founded in 2005 and is housed in the Venetian - Turkish monument known as Diikitirio ("Headquarters"). Its exhibits provide a longitudinal picture of the region's history from prehistory to late antiquity, i.e. the early Christian Times. The exhibition is divided into sections based on chronological and local criteria and covers the ground and first floor of the building.
