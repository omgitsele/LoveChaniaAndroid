Built in the district of Splazia, in 1320, it was for the Venetians one of the most important churches of the city. Later under the Ottoman rule, it was converted into a mosque and a minaret was erected on its left side. From 1918 it was converted to Orthodox church and was again dedicated to the memory of Agios Nikolaos.
