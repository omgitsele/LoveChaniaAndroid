Having experience in good food since 1988 in Kolymbari, we open one new restaurant in 2005
at the end of the pedestrian street at the beach of Nea Chora. Always serving fresh fish and meat,
we only want to impress hearts of the locals and visitors, with fun, smiles
and hospitality. Our good prices and our staff are an additional reasons to visit us at
"Achilleas".

We are open all year round, daily from 12 noon to late at night.

During the winter season, our restaurant is closed every Monday.
The Michailidis family can't wait to leave you with the best impressions ...
