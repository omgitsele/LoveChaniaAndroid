Built by the Venetians in the late sixteenth century and destroyed by a storm during the Turkish occupation, the lighthouse was later rebuilt by the Egyptians between 1824 and 1832, with the appearance of a minaret. Today it is completely restored and its base is still Venetian origin. With its charming and admirable architecture, it is one of the main attractions of the old city.
