Authentic Turkish Hammam with all traditional treatments, where beauty, well-being, body care, and relaxation of the mind are experienced in harmony.
In the beautiful town of Chania you can see the harmonic co-existence of different traditional architectures Venetian, Arabic, Ottoman.

This is the beauty and the uniqueness of this town. One of the most interesting elements of this architectural puzzle is the old Ottoman Baths, which you can find in ruins... The Hammams were brought to Chania by the Ottomans of Asia Minor.

As Sherazade, the unforgettable protagonist of "A Thousand and One Nights" said: "A town is incomplete without a Hammam." Crossing the threshold, you enter a new dimension where old world traditions are infused with modern day services. Unlike Spas that call any steam room a Hammam, Al Hammam is the only one, authentic Hammam with all natural, organic, and traditional treatments, where beauty, well-being, body care, and relaxation of the mind are experienced in harmony.

The Hammam will cleanse your body in a heated, low-mist room atop heated Venetian Marble tables, where an aesthetician exfoliates you and delivers an invigorating, full body Gommage using authentic black Moroccan Olive Oil Soap - your skin will be left feeling soft and supple - a prelude to your Hammam body ceremony.
