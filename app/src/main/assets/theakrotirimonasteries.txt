Located north of the Akrotiri peninsula and close to each other, Moni Agia Triada, Moni Gouverneto and Moni Katoliko, are among the most ancient monasteries and the most striking of the island.

Agia Triada, founded in the seventeenth century, was one of the most important monasteries of Chania. Because of its size, it can accommodate hundreds of monks and has kept its unique beauty year after year.

Moni Gouverneto, built in 1548 on top of a narrow gorge, less big than Agia Triada, but still retains an ancient and discreet charm. Behind him you can find a small museum of effects and sacred icons.

Moni Katoliko, fully excavated in the rock, is probably the oldest monastery in Crete, the ruins date back to the eleventh century. It is accessible only by foot and along the way you can admire the cave Katoliko, where lived St. John the Hermit.
