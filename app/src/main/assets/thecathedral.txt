Also known as the Church of the Virgin Mary of Trimartiri, patron saint of the city of Chania. It was built in the early nineteenth century on the site of a Venetian church that the Turks during the Ottoman occupation had turned into a soap factory. It looks like a three-nave basilica, hence the name Trimartiri.
