We are excited by having you at our website, thanks for visiting! At this opportunity we'd like to present our restaurant in the best possible light as we always do but stay transparent at the same time. The fact that you're here before visiting our place could be somewhat important. Beside common presentation of who we are or what we are standing for we'd also like to add a few words or images of what we are not. Your satisfaction is very important to us and your well deserved vacation is precious to both so please dedicate few minutes and read "About" section before rushing to make reservation. It simply might be important that To Antikristo is not located at good Chania business spot so we do not have any sea or mountain view and that's clear example.  Please take a look at those few pages we have once you're here. If you decide to visit us we'll be happy to "fire up", strive and give our best for you!
