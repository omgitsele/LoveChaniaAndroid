25 km south west of Kissamos, at the end of the grooves Kambos, lies the small bay Platanakia. A fascinating and lonely place surrounded by nature, made of rocks and sand, almost always deserted. Accessible by car (4x4), driving carefully, following a dirt road for 5 km, which starts Kambos, then you have to walk about 15 minutes. The beach is not equipped. Also frequented by nudists.
