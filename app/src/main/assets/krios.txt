Krios is located about 9 km west of the city of Paleochora and is the ideal place to relax. The beach is characterized by small stones and fresh crystal clear water, surrounded by a natural landscape and no tourist facilities. Accessible by car, Krios has a tavern bar, parking, toilets and parasols. About 15 minutes of unpaved road starting from the main beach, you can reach the bay "Cape Krios" where once existed the ancient city of Viena.
