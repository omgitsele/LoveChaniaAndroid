Born in the classical period and inhabited until Roman times, Lissos grew rich thanks to the maritime trade. This ancient city is located south of Chania, an hour's walk from Sougia, also accessible by boat or if you prefer by car through Paleochora. There are many vestiges, in particular a temple dedicated to Asclepius God of the medicine for the Greeks and Romain there.
