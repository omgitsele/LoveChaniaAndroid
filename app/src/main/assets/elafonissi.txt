 It's difficult to describe the beauty of this place, located 75km from the city of Chania. Its beach has nothing to envy to the tropical paradise, white sand pink reflections and turquoise waters in shades of light. The island, located in front of the beach, you can explore it on foot through the shallow waters of the lagoon. Accessible by car or bus, Elafonissi is equipped for tourists with parking, toilets, bar, sun loungers, parasols and taverns in the area.
