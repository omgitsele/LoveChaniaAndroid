This century old heritage stone house in the heart of the city is fully restored with all modern amenities while keeping it's old world charm. It consists of 3 individual apartments, 2 of them sharing the same main entrance at Evans Street and 1 at the western side of the building facing a traffic-free street with private main entrance. Situated in a easy to park street you'll enjoy being right in the middle of the historical and touristic amenities without the road noise.
