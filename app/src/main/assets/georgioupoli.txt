Georgioupoli is the small fishing village that takes the name of Prince George of Greece, High Commissioner of the island during the last years of the Ottoman occupation. It is here that the Almiros river meets the sea, creating a small marina on the one hand and a splendid range of 9 km, on the other. Many taverns and bars are nestled throughout the walk, and the nature that surrounds the village is simply amazing, it makes Georgioupoli much more than a tourist city.
