In a time, was here near hundred churches, today, unfortunately, we can admire only ruins... Sfakia is a small town with a glorious past, which succeeded thanks to its tough and rebellious population, to resist the Venetian and Ottoman occupation. At about 12 km, remains Fragokastello built by the Venetians to protect the nobles, their properties and to impose order in the region. Today, the fortress can be admired and not far away stands the basilica of Agios Nikitas and the monastery of Agios Charalambos.
